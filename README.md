This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server: [x]

```bash
npm run dev

```
## WIREFRAME
<img src="https://github.com/Raqueldelamer/next-cats/blob/cat2/src/pages/cat/canva-cat.jpg" > <br />

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Fetching Data from an API [x]

Fetching data from an API is a common task in web development. In this exercise, you will learn how to fetch data from an API and display it in your components using React hooks.

The challenge will be using hooks like `useEffect` and `useState` to fetch data from an API. You will likely not understand the entire process at first, but that's okay. The goal is to expose yourself to React hooks. 

Take notes, and bookmark the documentation you need. As you practice more, you will become more comfortable with these concepts.

## Objective [x]

Update your Cats Cats Cats project to access an API and display the data in your components.

The API you will be using is here (you may change the breed to any breed you like):

 [x]   https://cats-cats-cats-demo.deno.dev/cats/russian

[x] Use the fetch API, useEffect, and useState to fetch the data and display it in your components.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Stretch Goal 2 Error handling or loading state [x]

Watch the video from the reading on how to handle errors and/or loading states. Implement this in your project.

### Stretch Goal 3 Custom API [x]

Try to use a different API to fetch data. You can use any open API you like. (Avoid using API's with authentication for this exercise.)

## Deploy on Vercel [x]

[x] https://next-cats-omega.vercel.app/cat (DEPLOYED ON VERCEL)

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
