- **Project Overview**: A brief description of what the project does.
- **Setup Instructions**: How to run the project locally, including dependencies and installation steps.
- **Endpoints**: Document the `/api/cats`, `/api/pokemon`, and `/api/trivia` endpoints. (Very briefly describe the data that is returned from each of these endpoints.)
- **Postman Collection**: Include screenshots of the Postman requests for the three APIs (`/api/cats`, `/api/pokemon`, `/api/trivia`). Ensure that each request is clearly labeled.
- **Deployed Link**: Add the link to your deployed project (e.g., `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`).
